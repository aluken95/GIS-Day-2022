# GIS-Day-2022
Thank you for viewing our poster *"A spatial science approach to inform delivery of a smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention"* at The College on Problems of Drug Dependence's 2022 Annual Meeting. 

This repository contains supplemental tables and figures.

Figure 1 - Percent of smoking events within geofences for Census blocks among four participants at quartiles of EMA self-report data. We chose 0.3 because it captured at least 80% of smoking events for all but one case.

Figure 2 - Percent of smoking events captured within each geofence method for four participants.

Figure 3 - Geofences constructed by the Census block vs. 500 ft.2 fishnet grid at noon to 2:59 pm for one case.

Figure 4 - Census blocks with any smoking reports for 100th percentile case across all hours of the day. 

Table 1 - Baseline characteristics for the sampled cases versus overall sample.

Table 2 - Smoking and non-smoking events of the case studies.

Supplemental Table 1 - Normalized mean KDE statistics per case.
